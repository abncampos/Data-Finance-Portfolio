# Personal Budget Dashboard

A simple dashboard to track monthly income and expenses.

## What I did
- Cleaned budget data
- Built interactive graphs to show cash flow and spending categories
- Used Dash to create a web dashboard

## Main Tools
- pandas
- plotly & dash

This helped me learn to build visual tools to understand personal finance habits better.
